This is a port of [oatmealine](https://oat.zone)'s [FunFriend Desktop Pet](https://git.oat.zone/oat/funfriend) from Crystal to Rust.

This project exists because oat's program is over two years old, and not only uses a language that barely anyone uses, but also has outdated dependencies.
It's also really hard to even build the thing on Windows systems, and while I was able to build it on my Linux system,
I am unable to get it to run due to a GLFW error coming from one of the old deps. I also wanted an excuse to practice Rust.

This my second attempt at this project, hopefully it goes better this time :)
